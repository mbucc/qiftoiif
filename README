A Python utility to convert QIF files to IIF files.

For Luddites like me who can't quite get used to the idea of
using Mint for finances, are stuck with QuickBooks, and have
banks that refuse to pay the Intuit charge for web connect.

	status: testing

To run, 

    python src/qiftoiif.py <in.qif> <out.iif> <acct_name>

Requires that you export your chart of accounts and vendor
list from Quickbooks to the files coa.iff and vendors.iif. 
These two files are expected to be in the current working
directory of python.

To export your chart of accounts in Quickbooks,

	(1)	Open Quickbooks

	(2)	Open the "File" menu

	(3)	Pick "Export"

	(4)	Pick "Lists to IIF File"
	
	(5)	Check the "Chart of Accounts" box (and only
		that box).

	(6)	Click OK

	(7)	Enter coa.iff as the filename and save to
		the same directory as the qiftoiif.py script.

Vendor export is identical, but check the "Vendor List" box
in step (5).

Files in ./src/:

	tokens.py + grammar.py
		Lex and yacc combo to parse qif files.
	qif.py
		Data structures that store result of parsing
		qif file.
	coa.py + vendors.py
		Interface to Chart of Accounts and Vendor list
		exports from QuickBooks.
	interpreter.py
		Another lex and yacc combo, this time to parse
		user input in response to prompts about current
		QIF record.  Lots of code, but main purpose
		is to assign an account to the payee.
	vendoraccount.py
		Save account/vendor associations to save data entry.
		One QuickBooks feature I really like.
	iif.py
		Logic that outputs IIF text.
