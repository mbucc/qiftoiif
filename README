	status: under development.

To run, 

	python src/qiftoiif.py <yourfile.qif>

Requires that you export your chart of accounts and vendor
list from Quickbooks to the files coa.iff and vendors.iif. To
export your chart of accounts in Quickbooks,

	(1)	Open Quickbooks

	(2)	Open the "File" menu

	(3)	Pick "Export"

	(4)	Pick "Lists to IIF File"
	
	(5)	Check the "Chart of Accounts" box (and only
		that box).

	(6)	Click OK

	(7)	Enter coa.iff as the filename and save to
		the same directory as the qiftoiif.py script.

Vendor export is identical, but check the "Vendor List" box
in step (5).
